# customer_banking Assignment
## By Sami Chowdhury

This was again a very simple assignment. I was able to complete it very quickly as the code was reusable for most of the assignment and very closely followed what was taught in class. I was easily able to solve this assignment by myself from just looking at the assignment code given and the materials in class.

**To run this code, after cloning into this repository and changing directory to customer_banking, please run the following command in terminal:**

``> python customer_banking.py``
